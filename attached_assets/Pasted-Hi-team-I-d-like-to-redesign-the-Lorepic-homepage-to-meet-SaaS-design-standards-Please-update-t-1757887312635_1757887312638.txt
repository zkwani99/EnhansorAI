Hi team 👋

I’d like to redesign the Lorepic homepage to meet SaaS design standards. Please update the homepage according to the following structure and design rules:

Lorepic Homepage Redesign Spec
🔹 Design Rules
* Alternate section backgrounds: Light → Dark → Light → Dark
* Add scroll-triggered animations (fade-in, slide-up, counters)
* Gallery should be dynamic (mix static images + short auto-play video loops)
* Final CTA should use a dark gradient background

New Homepage Structure
1. Hero Section (Light)
    * Headline: “Bring Your Ideas to Life with AI-Powered Creativity”
    * Subheadline: short tagline (max 2 lines).
    * CTAs: Start Free (primary) and See Examples (secondary).
    * Show 4 service buttons (Image Enhancement, Text-to-Image, Image-to-Video, Text-to-Video) below hero CTAs as icon-based quick links.
2. Why Lorepic? (Dark)
    * Combined version of “What Makes Us Different” + USPs.
    * Title: “Why Lorepic?”
    * 3–4 columns with icons + text (AI-powered, Fast, Affordable, Flexible).
    * Animation: slide-up cards.
3. Discover Services (Light)
    * 4 service cards with hover effects.
    * Each card includes small CTA: “Try Now”.
4. Gallery & Examples (Dark, Dynamic)
    * Grid of images + auto-play video loops.
    * Hover expands preview.
    * Animation: fade-in staggered grid.
5. AI Template Library (Light)
    * Title: “AI Templates for Every Need”.
    * Tags + filters (Social Media, Marketing, YouTube, etc.).
    * Hover preview + “Use Template” button.
6. Why Choose Us (Dark)
    * Use black design like the screenshot reference I shared.
    * Show 3–4 big stats/counters (e.g., Templates, Speed, Uptime).
7. Pricing & Credits (Light)
    * Homepage only has a short CTA block → “See Plans & Credit Packs”
    * Button: View Pricing → /pricing
    * Full pricing details remain on /pricing.
8. Final CTA (Dark Gradient)
    * Headline: “Ready to Create Smarter?”
    * Subheadline: “Join thousands already using Lorepic to turn ideas into stunning visuals and videos.”
    * CTA: Start Free Today


This should make the homepage more engaging, SaaS-standard, and conversion-focused.

Thanks 🚀
